## What?
Compresses your javascript files, using uglifyjs and the uglifier gem when you save your source file.

## Use
if you haven't already:

    gem install uglifier

then

    git clone https://github.com/erick2red/guard-uglify.git
    cd guard-uglify
    rake install

in your project's directory root

    guard init
    guard init uglify

which will add this to your Guardfile  

    guard 'uglify',
      :input => "app/assets/javascripts",
      :output => "public/javascripts",
      :uglifier => {
          :mangle => {
            :toplevel => true
          },
          :compress => {
            :drop_console => true,
          }
        }

Adjust the paths, and set the options, `:uglifier` options contains the options passed to Uglifier gem which you can find [here][1].

Note that:

1. every minified file will contain the *.min.js* suffix
2. Files in your source folder with that same suffix won't be minifed.
